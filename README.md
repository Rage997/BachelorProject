# Bachelor Project

This repository contains my final project for the Bachelor degree in Informatics. It consists of developing a 3D processing pipeline to optimise 3D objects to be visualised in a virtual reality environment. I developed the project working at Hegias, a Swiss company that is specialised in virtual reality solutions for architects. Unfortunately, for this reason, I'm not allowed to share any code publicly.
